#Church Plant Web App

This will be a web app designed to help church plants grow and manage discipleship. Motto: #LoveBetter.

Currently just a test database in MongoDB I've set up to track church members.

Notes:
Need to create a meeting section in Members to include meetings and appointments with all of them.

Right now -- meeting with Dave Ellis at 6:30
Doing 11:30-12:30 at Daniel's Kitchen all week, and some other time on Thursday to fill in.

Need to add and contact all circles in main doc, then add italicized in main page, and then add recent contacts. Not sure how to approach yet.

Right now -- prep Dave Ellis meeting + board meeting review.
